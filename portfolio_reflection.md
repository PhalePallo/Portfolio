## 🎓 What I Learned

Throughout the bootcamp, I strengthened my technical foundation through structured labs, guided projects, and real-world development exercises.

### ✔️ Strong Technical Fundamentals
I gained practical exposure across several high-demand technology fields, providing a holistic understanding of how modern digital systems operate:
* **Generative AI**
* **Low-Code Development**
* **Data Engineering**
* **Cloud Engineering (AWS/Azure)**

### ✔️ Applied, Hands-On Experience
I developed essential technical skills in:
* **Building structured applications** (React, HTML/CSS/JS, Power Apps)
* Working with **SQL databases** and building **Python ETL pipelines**
* **Deploying workloads** using AWS & Azure
* Using **Docker, CI/CD, and Git** for modern software delivery

### ✔️ Industry-Ready Workflows
The programme strengthened my capabilities in:
* **Agile methodology**
* **Version control** with Git/GitHub
* Debugging, **problem-solving**, and testing
* **AI-assisted development** and prompt engineering

### ✔️ Full Project Ownership
The capstone project required me to plan, design, implement, test, document, and present a full solution—mirroring real industry expectations and preparing me for professional environments.

## 🔗 How the Capstone Integrates Bootcamp Concepts

My capstone project brought together the full breadth of the bootcamp experience, acting as a consolidation of all four domains: **AI, Low-Code, Data, and Cloud**.

* **AI + Software Development:** Used prompt engineering and AI-assisted development to speed up UI development, troubleshoot issues, and write cleaner code.
* **Frontend Engineering:** Designed a structured, responsive project using best practices gained from hands-on web development labs.
* **Cloud Awareness:** Applied cloud concepts (deployment models, compute, storage) learned during AWS/Azure fundamentals to make the project cloud-ready.
* **Data Engineering Thinking:** Implemented clean data flow, state management, and component communication inspired by pipeline design principles.
* **Version Control & Agile:** Tracking work in Git, writing clean commit messages, testing, and iterating quickly based on feedback.
* **Documentation & Presentation:** Delivered professional documentation and presented my work clearly, similar to real technical interviews or project demos.
